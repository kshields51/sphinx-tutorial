# Creating an "Important" or "Note" Box

To create a box that separates itself from the rest of the text to highlight something important, simply use this code snippet.

:::
```{important}
This is very important
```
:::
YIELDS:
```{important}
This is very important
```

To make it a note:

:::
```{note}
This is a note
```
:::
YIELDS:
```{note}
This is a note
```


```{literalinclude} embed_this.py
:language: python
```
